Include the following sections:

Project title and link to proposal
Title: Food Access in Los Angeles and Spatial Relation with Coronary Heart Disease Prevalence
Proposal link; https://github.com/madham6/up221-foodaccess/blob/main/GroupProjectProposal.md

Roles: Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what”.

Researcher: revises research question/proposal, finds methods that will work for our project, finds new data if needed - Meaghan
Communicator: turns in all the assignments on time, creates google slides for midterm, manages group repo / looks over individual repos, emails to chris - Madi
Head coder: makes last decisions for coding [not in charge of coding the whole project], asks TAs/chris/slack about error codes, creates the overall organization/work flow of code [subject to editing by editor]  -Branden
Markdown editor: cleans notebook for submission, maps maps as presentable as possible -Jessica

Status update: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
In general, the mood of the team is good. We were able to smoothly develop a proposal and our communication has been efficient. Moving forward, it might work better for us to meet all together before the weekend.

Data update: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.
Our data sources seem complete, but they are from different years
At the moment, we’re not concerned too much and are all set with our data sources
Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."
Major concerns: timing to pull this together
Minor Concerns: still getting used to jupyter/github organization
