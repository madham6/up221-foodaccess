## Our research question and why it is important
We plan to understand the relationship between food access (via grocery store location and access to EBT assistance) and adult health outcomes (specifically heart health) in Los Angeles County. Areas with low food availability do not exist randomly throughout the county of Los Angeles, often correlated with race and income as private corporations prefer locations in higher-income neighborhoods and avoid areas with higher rates of crime (this is not an implication that these two are mutually exclusive). When grocery stores avoid an area, one's access to food is limited to liquor stores, fast food restaurants, and convenience stores. Even government assistance like EBT is only as useful as the food available. Low-income neighborhoods typically have higher rates of zero-vehicle households. Combined with the fact that public transportation can be crowded and carrying grocery bags takes lots of energy, having a grocery store or other source of food is essential. Recently, a growing movement to address the 'food apartheid' issue has led to more community-based food sovereignty through local farmers markets for low-income neighbors, community fridges, and food resources through churches or local organizations. 

We also know that food insecurity is associated with cardiovascular disease through a [circular association](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8702994/#:~:text=Individuals%20with%20very%20low%20food,higher%20likelihood%20of%20cardiovascular%20mortality.). How have these efforts addressed the food apartheid reality and have they addressed the long-term health concerns associated with low food availability? Our research hopes to understand the impact of government policy, community effort, and private interests on cardiovascular health in the County of Loss Angeles over the past decade.

## An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
As public health and urban planning students, the goal of our research and education is to provide people with access to lead healthy lives. This is heavily influenced by policies beyond peoples' control, so our research is designed to understand how the private market (grocery store location) and assistance policies (EBT) interact to give Angelenos access to healthy food.

## A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
Our project focuses on the county of Los Angeles because of our existing knowledge of the area's policies and the availability of data. If possible, our analysis will look across time in the region, but our datasets have current information going back to ...?
